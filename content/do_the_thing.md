Summary: A promise to myself: Do the thing

This post serves as a resolution. Perhaps it is a new years resolution. "But it's halfway through February already" you might be saying. This is is true, which is why I'm writing this. The resolution is as follows:

## <center> "Do the thing" </center>

Short, simple, to the point. I need to do the thing. This blog was started in November of last year, and has yet to have a single post. I have 3 open source projects I'm in various stages of developement of, and yet can't seem to finish. I'm a student in grad school who desperately needs to finish his research. And yet I can't seem to find the time to accomplish any of this. Why? Because I'm failing to do the thing.

There are numerous [books on the subject](http://www.amazon.com/The-Top-Productivity-Books/lm/R2VY1USRYM17P9), but in the end it all comes down to doing the thing. Just do the thing. That's really all there is.

And so, to you the internet, I promise to do the thing. All the things. By putting this up here, I expect to be held accountable. Currently the list of things includes (in no particular order):

1. [Control.jl](https://github.com/jcrist/Control.jl) 
2. [Slicot.jl](https://github.com/jcrist/Slicot.jl)
3. This blog (I really want to start writing)
4. School
5. Teaching
6. Research

That's only 6 things. 5 really, because Control.jl and Slicot.jl are very intertwined. I think I can do it. So here we go. I've blocked Reddit, canceled Netflix. It's time to dive in. Time to do the thing.

P.S. I'm a big fan of Bre Pettis's ["Cult of Done Manifesto"](http://www.brepettis.com/blog/2009/3/3/the-cult-of-done-manifesto.html). It's definitely tongue in cheek, but some of the items are pretty good. Especially "Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done".
