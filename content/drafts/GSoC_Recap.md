Summary: Thoughts and musings on my Google Summer of Code experience

## Things I learned

- Git
- Software Design
- How to read code
- Code tools (pdb, profiling)
- Dynamics (kane's method)
- Team coding
- Code review

## Things I felt

- Nice to be excited and interested in your work
- I'm a shitty mechanical engineer
- Sometimes things Just Need A Decision(TM)
- Left the program with more ideas than I came in with
- Nice to stand back and say "I wrote that"

## Thoughts on the program

- Mailing list is a *bad* idea
- Really helped my programming proficiency - full time developer
- Open source is amazing
