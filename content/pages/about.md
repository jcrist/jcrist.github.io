I'm **Jim**. Born and raised in Minneapolis, MN, currently working for
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) in Austin, TX.

## Background

I used to be a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of
Minnesota. My research was in the domain of system dynamics and controls,
focused on system identification and state estimation for electro-mechanical
systems. I was drawn to this field due to its inherent multidisciplinary nature
&mdash; knowledge of mechanics, electronics, and software are all required.  My
final project was in the application of novel estimator designs to reduce the
hardware requirements for actuators. Sometimes you don't need more or better
sensors, just a fancier algorithm.

During graduate school I became involved in several open-source projects,
mostly in the scientific python community, which is how I ended up working at
Anaconda (then Continuum Analytics).

## Other Interests

I spend my free time on my hobbies. I started rock climbing around 10 years
ago, and that has easily become the most addicting thing in my life. I also
dabble in woodworking, crocheting, gardening, baking, and homebrewing.
