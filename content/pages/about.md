I'm **Jim**. Born and raised in Minneapolis, MN. 

I must have liked the city well enough, because I'm currently a grad student
here at the University of Minnesota.

Here's my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByJJ-ULxShedN29pSmYycko4Tms/edit?usp=sharing),
if you're into those things.

## Professional Interests

My research is in the domain of system dynamics and controls, focused on system
identification and state estimation for electro-mechanical systems. I was drawn
to this field due to its inherent multidisciplinary nature &mdash; knowledge of
mechanics, electronics, and software are all required. Currently my research is
in the application of novel estimator designs to reduce the hardware
requirements for actuators. Sometimes you don't need more or better sensors,
just a fancier algorithm.

I'm also interested in the development of open-source tools for scientific
computing. For years Matlab has been the main tool in this field, but recently
this seems to be changing. The trend towards open-source toolsets has
repercussions beyond just reduced cost, most notably the reproducability of
research simulations. When the first step of your method isn't "purchase
Matlab", people are more likely to attempt to replicate your research. You can
read more about my contributions to this field below.

## Code

A good portion of my work involves writing software, some of which resides on
[my GitHub account](https://www.github.com/jcrist). Most of my work of late has
been in using C for hardware control, with a Python wrapped interface. I also
do most of my analysis and simulations using the scientific Python software
stack.

I'm also active in a couple open source projects:

- [SymPy](http://sympy.org) &mdash; a computer algebra system written in Python
- [PyDy](https://github.com/pydy/pydy) &mdash; tools for dynamic systems analysis, in Python
- [Control.jl](https://github.com/JuliaControl/Control.jl) &mdash; a control theory toolbox in Julia


## Other Interests

I spend my free time (what little of it I have) on my hobbies. I started rock
climbing around 4 years ago, and that has easily become the most addicting thing
in my life. I used to be surprised by how many other engineers I know that
climb, but in retrospect it kind of makes sense. In climbing getting to the top
of a route (or "problem" in bouldering) is equal parts physical *and* mental.
Sure, you have to have the strength to stay on the wall, but a big part of it
is also figuring out the correct sequence of movements. And if there's one
thing all engineers enjoy it's solving problems.

Due to a fun 1 credit class I took a few years back, I also dance West Coast
Swing on a fairly regular basis. It's not been as often as I'd like lately
(school is busy), but I still try to go at least once or twice a month.
As with climbing, dancing offers the opportunity to zone out for a while and
just *be*. After a busy week, this is something I desperately need.

## About the Name

The name of this site comes from a term in dynamics/control theory referring to
a system that once hit with an impulse will oscillate forever, never growing or
shrinking in magnitude. While most of my academic research and focus is in the
field of control theory, I have lots of other interests too that I oscillate
between. I believe that this shift of interests isn't harmful, but actually
leads me to lead a fuller life, and (hopefully) become a better engineer in the
process.
