I'm **Jim**. Born and raised in Minneapolis, MN, currently working for
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) in Austin, TX.

## Background

I used to be a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of
Minnesota. My research was in the domain of system dynamics and controls,
focused on system identification and state estimation for electro-mechanical
systems. I was drawn to this field due to its inherent multidisciplinary nature
&mdash; knowledge of mechanics, electronics, and software are all required.
My final project was in the application of novel estimator designs to
reduce the hardware requirements for actuators. Sometimes you don't need more
or better sensors, just a fancier algorithm.

During graduate school I became involved in several open-source projects,
mostly in the scientific python community. Projects I currently work on, or
have spent a significant time on in the past include:

- [Dask](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/) &mdash; a flexible parallel computing framework
- [Dask-SearchCV](https://github.com/dask/dask-searchcv) &mdash; hyper-parameter search using Scikit-Learn and Dask
- [Skein](https://jcrist.github.io/skein/) &mdash; a tool and library for easy deployment on Apache YARN
- [Dask-Yarn](http://dask-yarn.readthedocs.io/) &mdash; A library for deploying dask on Apache YARN
- [Conda-Pack](https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/) &mdash; A tool for packaging Conda environments for redistribution
- [Crick](https://github.com/jcrist/crick/) &mdash; streaming and approximate algorithms
- [Datashader](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader) &mdash; a bin-based rendering toolchain
- [SymPy](http://sympy.org) &mdash; a computer algebra system written in Python
- [PyDy](https://github.com/pydy/pydy) &mdash; tools for dynamic systems analysis, in Python
- [ControlSystems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlSystems.jl) &mdash; a control systems toolbox for Julia

## Other Interests

I spend my free time on my hobbies. I started rock climbing around 10 years
ago, and that has easily become the most addicting thing in my life. I also
dabble in woodworking, crocheting, gardening, baking, and homebrewing.
