This page is nothing but links to things I like. Skim away!

## Blogs

- [Pythonic Perambulations](http://jakevdp.github.io/) &mdash; General thoughts on python and science.
- [Equals Zero](http://www.etotheipiplusone.net/) &mdash; Robots and stuff.
- [Moorepants](http://www.moorepants.info/blog/) &mdash; Updates on Jason's work (one of the PyDy devs).
- [Matthew Rocklin](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/) &mdash; Technical blog of Matt Rocklin, always interesting.

## Software:

Much of the work I do is using Python for scientific computing. Besides the
usual suspects ([NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](http://scipy.org/),
[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and [IPython](http://ipython.org/)), I
also make use of:

- [SymPy](http://sympy.org) &mdash; computer algebra system
- [PyDy](https://github.com/pydy/pydy) &mdash; tools for dynamic systems analysis
- [Cython](http://cython.org/) &mdash; easy, fast C extensions
- [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) &mdash; speed up code using an LLVM based jit
- [Numexpr](https://github.com/pydata/numexpr) &mdash; speed up array expressions
- [Toolz](http://toolz.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) &mdash; a better functional library

I've also been using [Julia](http://julialang.org/) a lately. While it took me
a bit to get used to the language, I find it to be very performant, while still
remaining easy to write (and read!). Some Julia libraries I like:

- [Gadfly](https://github.com/dcjones/Gadfly.jl) &mdash; plotting, similar to ggplot2
- [DataFrames](https://github.com/JuliaStats/DataFrames.jl) &mdash; tabular data analysis
- [Convex](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl) &mdash; disciplined convex programming

As far as workstation, I run [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), and make
heavy use of the shell. As such, I spent some time customizing my workflow. My
dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/jcrist/dotfiles), although
they're probably pretty poorly written. I use
[tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) as my terminal multiplexer, and
[tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) to store common window
setups. I switched to [vim](http://www.vim.org/) a few years back, and am
addicted (so much so that I invariably type ":w" into word documents).
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is my version control tool of choice.

## Electronics:

- [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) &mdash; a better, smaller, cheaper Arduino
- [BeagleBone Black](http://beagleboard.org/black) &mdash; for when the Teensy isn't powerful enough

## Suppliers:

- [McMaster Carr](http://www.mcmaster.com/) &mdash; the everything store
- [Oshpark](https://oshpark.com/) &mdash; the purplest cheap PCBs you'll ever find
- [Digikey](http://www.digikey.com/) &mdash; the McMaster of electronics
- [Ax-Man](http://www.ax-man.com/) &mdash; quirky local surplus store
- [Discount Steel](http://www.discountsteel.com/) &mdash; local metals supplier
