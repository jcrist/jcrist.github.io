Summary: Everything I read in 2017

Growing up I used to read *a lot*, but fell out of habit during college due to
lack of time. This year my new year's resolution was to read again. I set a
goal of reading 26 books (1 every 2 weeks), and managed to exceed that by 3.
Going to shoot for 30 in 2018 :). Here it is, everything I read in 2017:

29. *Sula* &mdash; Toni Morrison (12/31/2017)

Looking at the timeline, I read the most when I was flying (been traveling for
work more frequently). There's also a few blank spots where I started a book
and gave up on it (most recently retried *As I Lay Dying* by Faulkner, and
I still can't get through it).

A few highlights:

- *Infinite Jest* is a trope, but was still one of the best books I've ever
  read. I started it in 2016 and for a few months carried that 10 lb book
  everywhere, doubling as an exercise routine. Recommend.

- I read a good portion of Kurt Vonnegut's works this year. His pointed humor
  is still relevant 50 years later. Top picks: *Cat's Cradle* and *God Bless
  You Mr. Rosewater*.

- In high school we read one Toni Morrison book (Sula), and I didn't care for
  it then. Coming back to her 10 years later I now like her style (her content
  has depth and her descriptions are vivid without being overwhelming). If you
  read anything by her I recommend *The Bluest Eye*.

- *To Say Nothing of the Dog* by Connie Willis is one of the funniest books
  I've ever read. Every book Connie Willis has written has been nominated for
  (and usually won) the Hugo award for best novel. She's fantastic.

- *Wolf in White Van* by John Darnielle (of *The Mountain Goats*) was
  surprisingly good. I've loved his lyrics, but other musician-turned-authors
  haven't always been as appealing. I've also been enjoying the podcast *I Only
  Listen to The Mountain Goats* by him and Joseph Fink (of *Welcome to
  Nightvale*), although that may only appeal to fans.

- I didn't particularly care for *Blood Meridian*. Cormac McCarthy writes
  stunning descriptions of landscapes and vague descriptions of characters.
  This one takes place in Texas and is mildly historical, so it was neat to tie
  scene's to places I've been, but didn't make up for the book's deficiencies.
  It was also way darker than *The Road*, which I didn't think was possible.

- I read *The Ocean at the End of the Lane* in one sitting. Neil Gaiman is
  consistently great. Reminded me a bit of the dark childhood tales Roald Dahl
  is known for.

- *Homegoing* was on this year's [Stanford 3 book
  list](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/advising/approaching-stanford/three-books)
  (for incoming freshman), and is the most recently published book I read. I
  loved it enough to mail it to my sister, who's passing it on. Recommend.
