        <h1>Do the Thing</h1>
        <p>Sat 15 February 2014 &mdash; under
            <a class="post-category" href="/tag/ramblings.html">ramblings</a>
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>This post serves as a resolution. Perhaps it is a new years resolution. "But it's halfway through February already" you might be saying. This is is true, which is why I'm writing this. The resolution is as follows:</p>
<h2><center> "Do the thing" </center></h2>
<p>Short, simple, to the point. I need to do the thing. This blog was started in November of last year, and has yet to have a single post. I have 3 open source projects I'm in various stages of developement of, and yet can't seem to finish. I'm a student in grad school who desperately needs to finish his research. And yet I can't seem to find the time to accomplish any of this. Why? Because I'm failing to do the thing.</p>
<p>There are numerous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Top-Productivity-Books/lm/R2VY1USRYM17P9">books on the subject</a>, but in the end it all comes down to doing the thing. Just do the thing. That's really all there is.</p>
<p>And so, to you the internet, I promise to do the thing. All the things. By putting this up here, I expect to be held accountable. Currently the list of things includes (in no particular order):</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jcrist/Control.jl">Control.jl</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jcrist/Slicot.jl">Slicot.jl</a></li>
<li>This blog (I really want to start writing)</li>
<li>School</li>
<li>Teaching</li>
<li>Research</li>
</ol>
<p>That's only 6 things. 5 really, because Control.jl and Slicot.jl are very intertwined. I think I can do it. So here we go. I've blocked Reddit, canceled Netflix. It's time to dive in. Time to do the thing.</p>

<p>P.S. I'm a big fan of Bre Pettis's <a href="http://www.brepettis.com/blog/2009/3/3/the-cult-of-done-manifesto.html">"Cult of Done Manifesto"</a>. It's definitely tongue in cheek, but some of the items are pretty good. Especially "Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done".</p>
