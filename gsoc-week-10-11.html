    <p>I missed my post last week due to my research for grad school all going to hell
at the worst possible time :(. There wasn't much to report on last week, so I'm
not too perturbed. Turns out even with PRs done and tested, it still takes a
long time to get them merged and have everyone agree on them. Fortunately I
made up for it this week; as of now I am officially working on code generation!
This is behind schedule on my original timeline, but should have been expected,
as per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law">Hofstadter's law</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hofstadter's Law:</strong> "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you
take into account Hofstadter's Law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things are moving ahead now, and I have some hope left that I can accomplish
(most of) everything I set out to do.</p>
<h2>Project Status:</h2>
<p>I set out to accomplish a number of things this summer. Here's the status of
each project goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>General Linearization Form:</strong></p>
<p>Done!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Linearization methods for Kane's and Lagrange's Methods:</strong></p>
<p>Done! Lagrange stuff got merged last week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Documentation for the above:</strong></p>
<p>Done? This PR is waiting for review, but I think it's good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pre-linearized solution methods:</strong></p>
<p>Nixed from the plan due to lack of interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code Generation:</strong></p>
<p>In Progress...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also accomplished a few other things, that I found necessary for my project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Refactored <code>KanesMethod</code> and <code>LagrangesMethod</code>:</strong></p>
<p>This resulted in more readable, pythonic code, and also a speed/memory
improvement. PR for this is still awaiting review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Faster <code>subs</code> function for <code>mechanics</code>:</strong></p>
<p>My <code>msubs</code> implementation is several orders of magnitude faster than <code>subs</code>
for the kinds of expressions seen in <code>mechanics</code> (even without the benefit
of cacheing that <code>subs</code> has). This is in a PR awaiting review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Soooo much work on the <code>nan</code> and <code>oo</code> issue:</strong></p>
<p>Still not solved for <em>all</em> cases... :(</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>TODO:</h2>
<p>There are only 3 weeks left of GSoC! In my last remaining weeks, here's what I
plan to get done:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Get the Bicycle Example working:</strong></p>
<p>After my work everything runs faster, results in smaller, more tractable
expressions, and uses less memory. Except for the bicycle example. For some
unknown reason I can not get this thing to result in anything except <code>nan</code>.
This is a regress in performance (even though everything else runs better),
and needs to be solved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code generation:</strong></p>
<p>I've already got some stuff working, and it's really exciting. More on this
below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get all my current stuff merged:</strong></p>
<p>All that works needs to get into <code>Sympy</code>. As not everyone else is being paid
to do this, it can take some time and effort to get things through the
review process and into master, but I have hope that my remaining
contributions will eventually make it in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I can do it, but it'll be a stretch.</p>
<h2>Code Generation</h2>
<p>Sympy currently contains some facilities for code generation, but they lack
support for the matrices that are necessary for working with dynamics problems.
I hope to remedy that, as well as to make general improvements to the entire
codegen module.</p>
<p>Code generation in sympy has three levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Code Printers <code>ccode</code>, <code>fcode</code>, and the like</strong></p>
<p>These are printers that know how to print <em>simple</em> sympy expressions using
functionality and syntax found in that language. For example, <code>ccode</code> will
print exponents using <code>pow</code>, which is found in the <code>math</code> library in C.
These printers don't have any knowledge of functions, multiple statements,
or header files. They simply print a single expression out on one line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The <code>codegen</code> submodule</strong></p>
<p>This submodule contains facilities for representing generalized <em>routines</em>,
and generating functions in various languages (currently C and FORTRAN)
that can be compiled as a library without any changes. They know about 
function and variable declarations, header files, library imports, and
multi-line statements. However, they have no idea how to make this
generated code work with python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code wrapping, usually accessed through <code>autowrap</code></strong></p>
<p>This is where the functionality for <em>wrapping</em> the generated code lives.
Using the functionality provided here, one can compile and wrap generated
code, and then call it from python. The <code>autowrap</code> function is the main
entry point, allowing for all 3 steps to be done in one call.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first thing I wanted to fix was getting code generation to work with
matrices and matrix expressions. This turned out to be harder (and more
confusing) than I expected. There is currently support for a "matrix like"
object named <code>sympy.tensor.IndexedBase</code>, but I really don't understand the
purpose behind it. Reading through the code and examples though it seems to be
for representing indexed loop operations in a concise form. This unfortunately
has nothing to do with the indexed types (matrices) that I plan on
implementing.</p>
<p>I spent a long time reading through the code and playing around with it using
pdb trying to figure out the control flow in the codegen function, and am still
a little lost. Most of what's there seems to be for supporting the <code>Indexed</code>
operations.  After some time trying to bend them to work for matrices, I
changed plans and now am supporting <code>Matrix</code> and <code>MatrixExpr</code> types for matrix
operations only.  <code>Indexed</code> types can be used elsewhere, but they shouldn't be
used for representing matrices with expressions inside them.</p>
<p>I currently have this "working", but am not happy with it yet. The current
layout of the module made for some hacky work adding in matrix support. I plan
on doing some refactoring to make this implementation cleaner. Currently, on
my codegen branch the following is supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Generating C code for a matrix with expressions in each element:</strong></p>
<p>Matrices are set as input-output type arguments, and are modified in place
before being returned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Passing in a <code>MatrixSymbol</code> as an argument:</strong> </p>
<p>Here the plan is to use matrices to pass in a large number of arguments.
You can think of this kind of like a vector. There's another symbolic
vector type as well in Sympy (<code>DeferredVector</code>). I may end up supporting
it, but I'm not really sure what it's for. In its current implementation,
the following works:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">q</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">q1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">q2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">q3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">q4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">q5</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">q_vec</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MatrixSymbol</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;q&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">sub_dict</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">zip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">q</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">q_vec</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="c1"># Replaces each q with elements from q_vec</span>
<span class="n">expr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">msubs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">expr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">q_vec</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># Generate a function that takes a numpy array (q) and returns expr</span>
<span class="c1"># This works if expr is an expression, or a matrix</span>
<span class="n">func</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">autowrap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">expr</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


</li>
</ul>
<p>After I clean this up, I plan to add support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Common Subexpression Elimination (cse):</strong></p>
<p>Even though modern compilers do this already, experimentation shows that
the large expressions generated in <code>mechanics</code> benefit from generated code
having cse performed. This will be implemented as a boolean kwarg (default
False).  When True, sympy's <code>cse</code> function will be run on the expression,
and the code for each subexpression will be generated, followed by the
final expression.  I actually don't think this will be too difficult to
implement, and should give some speed improvements on the compiled code (at
the cost of slower generation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A <code>ctypes</code> code-wrapper:</strong></p>
<p>Currently the only code wrappers supported are <code>f2py</code> and <code>cython</code>, neither
of which is in the standard library. While the wrappers generated with those
functions may be more robust, a ctypes wrapper is also possible, with the
added benefit that <code>ctypes</code> is in the standard lib.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for matrix expressions:</strong></p>
<p>In an ideal world, I'd implement the excellent work done by Matthew
Rocklin, discussed in <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2028/matrix-expressions-and-blaslapack-scipy-2013-pr">this video from SciPy
2013</a>.
The idea here is that we have some knowledge about each of the matrices
involved in an <em>expression</em> (for example $A^{-1} B$). We may know that A is
positive definite, or symmetric, or upper triangular, etc... For each case,
there may be a faster inversion routine that we could take advantage of
rather than using a one-size-fits-all inverse function. As I don't have time
to implement support for all possible operations, and the many BLAS/LAPACK
routines that support them, I'll focus just on the inverse, as it's commonly
found in expressions in <code>mechanics</code>. The thought is, we should be able to
run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">func</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">autowrap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Inverse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">M</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">F</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And have code generated that solves the expression in a fast manner, without
having to symbolically find the inverse of <code>M</code> and combine it with <code>F</code> into
one matrix beforehand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course this is a wishlist, and it's unlikely all of this will be accomplished
in the next 3 weeks. Still, I plan to keep supporting <code>sympy</code> after my GSoC
ends, so if it's not done by then it will eventually get there.</p>

<h3>Other exciting news of the week:</h3>
<p>I got accepted to the GSoC reunion at the end of October! As this is the 10th
annual GSoC, Google is throwing a big reunion shindig for past and present
students. As there are lots of us, only a few were chosen based on a lottery,
and I made it through! I'm very excited to meet other students that completed
the program, listen to some interesting talks, and see the GooglePlex. I also
bought my tickets to get there a day early so I have some time to explore the
bay area. Last time I was out there I was 14, and I didn't get to see much
of the area. If you also got accepted/live out and would be interested in
meeting up, let me know! I'll be in San Jose/San Francisco October 23-26.</p>
