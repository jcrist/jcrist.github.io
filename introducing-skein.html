    <h1>Introducing Skein: Deploy Python on Apache YARN the Easy Way</h1>
    <p class="article-date">Posted on August 14, 2018</p>
    <div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We introduce <a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/">a new tool and library</a> for
deploying applications on Apache YARN. We provide background on why this work
was necessary, and demonstrate deploying a simple Python application on a YARN
cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html">Apache YARN</a> is the resource management and job scheduling framework
native to Hadoop clusters. It is responsible for scheduling applications on the
cluster (deciding where and when an application gets the resources it
requested) and provisioning these resources in a secure and robust way.</p>
<p>Many data-processing frameworks (e.g. Spark, Flink, Storm, etc...) support YARN
as a deployment option. As a contributor to <a class="reference external" href="http://dask.pydata.org/">Dask</a>, I sought to improve our
deployment support for YARN. This proved difficult for several reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>YARN is a JVM-only framework, and requires a non-trivial amount of Java to
get things working (for example, Spark's YARN support is ~6000 lines of
Scala). Dask is written in Python.</li>
<li>Applications that deploy on YARN need to distribute their resources with
them. For Java applications this is straightforward - just bundle everything
into a JAR and you're done. With Python things aren't so easy.</li>
<li>YARN security (if enabled) uses <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)">Kerberos</a>, which can be tricky to support
properly. Kerberos is so difficult to get right that one of the core Hadoop
developers <a class="reference external" href="https://steveloughran.gitbooks.io/kerberos_and_hadoop/sections/kerberos_the_madness.html">wrote a book</a>
where it's compared to the horrors found in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft">H.P. Lovecraft</a> novels. This,
coupled with the myriad of configuration options YARN supports can makes
testing applications difficult.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="sometimes things are difficult" class="align-center" src="/images/one-does-not-simply-deploy-on-yarn.jpg" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>I'm fairly happy with the set of tools we've developed to solve these problems.
The remainder of this post discusses them in detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="skein-easy-deployment-on-yarn">
<h2>Skein: Easy Deployment on YARN</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/">Skein</a> is a <em>declarative</em> tool for deploying applications on YARN. Users write
application specifications either in YAML or using the native Python API, and
Skein handles deploying and managing them on YARN.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Skein applications are written declaratively using a specificatin reminiscent
of <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/">docker-compose</a>. While YARN is extremely flexible, Skein is opinionated
about how an application should be structured. Sane defaults and reduced
options help simplify the user API and greatly reduce the amount of code
needed to deploy on YARN.</li>
<li>Every Skein application contains a <a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/key-value-store.html">key-value store</a> running on the
application master. This provides a way for containers to share runtime
configuration parameters (e.g. dynamically chosen addresses and ports), as
well as coordinate state between containers.</li>
<li>Skein applications are dynamic. Containers can be started and stopped at
runtime, allowing for services to scale to your needs.</li>
<li>Skein was designed &quot;API first&quot;, meaning both the <a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/api.html">Python API</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/cli.html">CLI</a> are
first-class-citizens, and should (hopefully) feel natural and intuitive (if
you find any rough edges, please <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jcrist/skein/issues">file an issue</a>).</li>
<li>Skein contains two (unfortunately necessary-ish) Java processes written as
<a class="reference external" href="http://grpc.io/">gRPC</a> services. This provides a clear separation between the application
language and Java, and means that other language bindings besides Python are
possible, allowing other languages to take advantage of this work.</li>
<li>Skein is tested on multiple Hadoop configurations, including both <tt class="docutils literal">simple</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">kerberos</tt> security, to help ensure support across all clusters.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="example-echo-server">
<h2>Example: Echo Server</h2>
<p>To illustrate the intended workflow, we'll implement a simple echo server and
client, and use Skein to deploy on YARN.</p>
<p>The full code for this example can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jcrist/skein/blob/master/examples/echo_server/">here</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-echo-server">
<h3>The Echo Server</h3>
<p>The echo server is based off <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html#tcp-echo-server-using-streams">this example</a>
from the asyncio docs. The full server code is available <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jcrist/skein/blob/master/examples/echo_server/server.py">here</a>.
Walking through some of the Skein-specific bits:</p>
<p>Since the server could be run on any machine, we may not be sure what ports are
available on that machine, or the host address of the machine as seen from the
edge node. To handle this we start the server on a dynamic port, and then
determine the hostname and port at runtime.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Setup the server with a dynamically chosen port</span>
<span class="n">loop</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">asyncio</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_event_loop</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">coro</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">asyncio</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">start_server</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">handle_echo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;0.0.0.0&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">loop</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">loop</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">server</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">loop</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run_until_complete</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">coro</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Determine the dynamically chosen address</span>
<span class="n">host</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">socket</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">gethostbyname</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">socket</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">gethostname</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="n">port</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sockets</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getsockname</span><span class="p">()[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">address</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s1">:</span><span class="si">%d</span><span class="s1">&#39;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">host</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">port</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>To communicate this dynamic address back to the client, we store the address in
the <a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/key-value-store.html">key-value store</a>. To allow scaling up to multiple server instances (a bit
contrived for this example) we append the server's <tt class="docutils literal">container_id</tt> to a fixed
prefix (<tt class="docutils literal">'address.'</tt>) to ensure a unique key.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Form a unique key to store the address using the current container id</span>
<span class="n">key</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;address.</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s1">&#39;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">skein</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">properties</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">container_id</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We then store the server address in the key-value store. Note that we set the
current <tt class="docutils literal">container_id</tt> as the <em>owner</em> of the key. This makes use of Skein's
key-value store <a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/key-value-store.html#ownership">ownership model</a>. When the server's container exits (whether
successfully or due to failure), the key will be deleted. This helps ensure
that when servers shutdown their address is no longer available to the echo
client.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Connect to the application master</span>
<span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">skein</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ApplicationClient</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">from_current</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c1"># The key-value store only accepts bytes as values</span>
<span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">address</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">encode</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c1"># Store the server address in the key-value store, assigning the current</span>
<span class="c1"># container as the owner of the key. This ensures that the key is deleted if</span>
<span class="c1"># the container exits.</span>

</pre></div>
<p>The remainder of the echo server implementation is generic <tt class="docutils literal">asyncio</tt>
operations - providing a handler, starting up the server, and running the event
loop until shutdown.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-echo-client">
<h3>The Echo Client</h3>
<p>The echo client is based off <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html#asyncio-tcp-echo-client-streams">this example</a>
from the asyncio docs. The full client code is available <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jcrist/skein/blob/master/examples/echo_server/client.py">here</a>.
Walking through some of the Skein-specific bits:</p>
<p>When using either the <a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/cli.html">CLI</a> or the <a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/api.html">Python API</a>, most operations require an
<em>application id</em>. This is a unique identifier for your application in YARN, and
is used both by Skein and by external tools (for example, the <tt class="docutils literal">yarn</tt> CLI
command). In our example echo-client here we provide the application id via the
command-line, and then use it to connect to the application</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Get the application id from the command-line args</span>
<span class="n">app_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="c1"># Connect to the application</span>
<span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">skein</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Client</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">app_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Before we can send a message to the echo server, we first need to get its
address. This again is done through the <a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/key-value-store.html">key-value store</a>. However, instead of
getting the address of a single echo server, we'll loop through all registered
addresses and message each of them. To do this we use the <a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/api.html#skein.kv.KeyValueStore.get_prefix">get_prefix</a>
method to get all keys that start with <tt class="docutils literal">address.</tt>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">async</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">echo_all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">message</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Send and recieve a message from all running echo servers&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

        <span class="c1"># Parse the host and port from the stored address</span>

        <span class="n">port</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">port</span><span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="c1"># Send the message to the echo server</span>
        <span class="n">await</span> <span class="n">tcp_echo_client</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">loop</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">host</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">port</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The remainder of the client implementation is generic - provide a async
function to message each server, start the event loop, and run until all
futures have completed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="packaging-the-python-environment">
<h3>Packaging the Python Environment</h3>
<p>Skein doesn't mandate a specific way of distributing application
files/executables. File resources may already exist on every node, or may need
to be distributed with the application. For Python applications, one way of
handling this is to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://conda.io/docs/">conda package manager</a> to create a Python
environment, and <a class="reference external" href="https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/">conda-pack</a> to package that environment for distribution.
This is what we'll do here.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">#</span> Create a new environment with all dependencies

</pre></div>
<p>During <a class="reference external" href="https://hortonworks.com/blog/resource-localization-in-yarn-deep-dive/">YARN Resource Localization</a> this environment can then be unpacked and
linked as a directory in every container.</p>
<p>For more information on file distribution in Skein, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/distributing-files.html">distributing files
docs</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-application-specification">
<h3>The Application Specification</h3>
<p>With a completed server and client implementation, we now need to write the
application specification. We'll only make use of a few of the specification
fields here; the full schema can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/specification.html">specification docs</a>.</p>
<p>The echo server specification can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jcrist/skein/blob/master/examples/echo_server/spec.yaml">here</a>,
and is also duplicated below:</p>

</pre></div>
<p>We define a single service <tt class="docutils literal">server</tt>, and specify that each instance needs
one virtual-core (usually equal to one CPU, cluster specific) and 256 MB of
memory. For file resources, we specify the packaged Conda environment, as well
as the server script. These will be mapped to <tt class="docutils literal">./environment/</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">./server.py</tt> in the container environment respectively. Finally we provide a
list of commands to run to start the service. For some services this may be
more complicated, but here it's just activating the packaged Conda environment
and running the server script.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="running-the-application">
<h3>Running the Application</h3>
<p>We're now ready to start the application. This could be done using the <a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/api.html">Python
API</a>, but here we'll make use of the <a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/cli.html">CLI</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">#</span> Start the application, and store the application id as APPID
<span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nv">APPID</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span>skein application submit spec.yaml<span class="sb">`</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This validates the specification, uploads any necessary file resources to HDFS,
and then submits the application to YARN. To check on the status of the
application we can use the <tt class="docutils literal">skein application status</tt> command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">#</span> Check the application status
<span class="gp">$</span> skein application status <span class="nv">$APPID</span>
<span class="go">APPLICATION_ID                    NAME          STATE      STATUS       CONTAINERS    VCORES    MEMORY    RUNTIME</span>
<span class="go">application_1534186866311_0009    echoserver    RUNNING    UNDEFINED    2             2         768       8s</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This shows 2 running containers: one for the application master, and one for
our echo server. You can also navigate to the YARN Web-UI to check on the
status of the application, based on the given application ID:</p>
<img alt="The YARN web-ui" class="align-center" src="/images/skein_resourcemanager_echoserver.png" style="width: 90%;" />
<p>Trying out our echo client:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> python client.py <span class="nv">$APPID</span>
<span class="go">Connecting to server at 172.18.0.4:41846</span>
<span class="go">Sent: &#39;Hello World!&#39;</span>
<span class="go">Received: &#39;Hello World!&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And it works! We see communication with a single echo server; the dynamic
address was found at <tt class="docutils literal">172.18.0.4:41846</tt>, and the message was sent and
returned successfully.</p>
<p>Next, lets try scaling up the number of echo servers using the <tt class="docutils literal">skein
container scale</tt> command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">#</span> Scale to <span class="m">4</span> server instances

<span class="go">server     server_2    RUNNING    3s</span>
<span class="go">server     server_3    RUNNING    2s</span>

<p>Running the echo client again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> python client.py <span class="nv">$APPID</span>
<span class="go">python client.py $APPID</span>
<span class="go">Connecting to server at 172.18.0.4:41846</span>

<p>This time we see communication with 4 different echo servers, one for each
server instance.</p>
<p>Finally, we can shutdown our application using the <tt class="docutils literal">skein application
shutdown</tt> command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">#</span> Shutdown the application
<span class="gp">$</span> skein application shutdown <span class="nv">$APPID</span>

<span class="gp">#</span> Show the application was shutdown
<span class="gp">$</span> skein application status <span class="nv">$APPID</span>
<span class="go">APPLICATION_ID                    NAME          STATE       STATUS       CONTAINERS    VCORES    MEMORY    RUNTIME</span>
<span class="go">application_1534186866311_0009    echoserver    FINISHED    SUCCEEDED    0             0         0         5m</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that if the <tt class="docutils literal">python server.py</tt> command exited itself (perhaps via a
<tt class="docutils literal">shutdown</tt> endpoint on the server), then the manual shutdown command wouldn't
be necessary. This can be nice for things like batch processing jobs that have
a distinct end, as they can then be submitted and run to completion without
further human intervention.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>To review, in the above example we</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Wrote a demo echo server and client.</li>
<li>Added YARN deployment support using Skein</li>
<li>Packaged the application dependencies using <a class="reference external" href="https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/">conda-pack</a></li>
<li>Started, scaled, and stopped the echo server on YARN</li>
</ul>
<p>All without writing a line of Java. Additionally, the Python code that was
needed to support YARN deployment was relatively short. While this example was
simplistic, we've found that real-world applications (such as the <a class="reference external" href="http://dask-yarn.readthedocs.io/">dask-yarn</a>
library) remain just as clear and concise (although this is more of a testament
to Python than to Skein).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing-skein">
<h2>Testing Skein</h2>
<p>As mentioned at the top, due to the myriad of configuration options, testing
that an application works on all YARN clusters can be difficult. The YARN
documentation <a class="reference external" href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YarnApplicationSecurity.html">is pretty adamant about this</a></p>
<blockquote>
If you don’t test your YARN application in a secure Hadoop cluster, it
won’t work.</blockquote>
<p>To test Skein, an external tool <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jcrist/hadoop-test-cluster">hadoop-test-cluster</a> was developed. This is a
pip-installable tool for creating and working with tiny dockerized test
clusters. Images with both <tt class="docutils literal">simple</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">kerberos</tt> security configurations
are available, and the tool is written to allow extending with further options.</p>
<p>Assuming you have docker already installed, using a kerberized test cluster is
as easy as</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">#</span> Start the cluster, mounting the <span class="nb">local</span> directory
<span class="gp">$</span> htcluster startup --image kerberos --mount .:workdir

<span class="gp">#</span> Login
<span class="gp">$</span> htcluster login

<span class="gp">#</span> Or run a <span class="nb">command</span> externally
<span class="gp">$</span> htcluster <span class="nb">exec</span> -- py.test mylibrary

<span class="gp">#</span> Shutdown the cluster
<span class="gp">$</span> htcluster shutdown
</pre></div>
<p>Making the tests easy to run locally has eased development, and helps ensure
Skein is robust across different Hadoop deployments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="review-and-future-work">
<h2>Review and Future Work</h2>
<p>We presented three new tools:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://jcrist.github.io/skein/">Skein</a> for easy deployment of applications on YARN.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/">conda-pack</a> for packaging the dependencies of these applications for
distribution.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jcrist/hadoop-test-cluster">hadoop-test-cluster</a> for no-fuss testing of Hadoop applications locally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, these tools help provide a workflow for bringing Python
applications to a traditionally Java based ecosystem.</p>
<p>These tools are currently being used to deploy Dask on YARN in the <a class="reference external" href="http://dask-yarn.readthedocs.io/">dask-yarn</a>
libary. Similar work is being investigated for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/2214">deploying Ray on YARN</a>, as well as adding a
non-Spark kernelspec to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/enterprise_gateway">Jupyter Enterprise Gateway</a>.</p>
<p>If this workflow looks useful to you, please feel free to reach out on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jcrist/skein">github</a>. Issues, pull-requests, and discussions
are welcome!</p>
