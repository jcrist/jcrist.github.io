    <p><img class="avatar" src="http://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2783717?s=200" /></p>
<p>I'm <strong>Jim</strong>. Born and raised in Minneapolis, MN, currently working for
<a href="https://www.continuum.io/">Continuum Analytics</a> in Austin, TX.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I used to be a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of
Minnesota. My research was in the domain of system dynamics and controls,
focused on system identification and state estimation for electro-mechanical
systems. I was drawn to this field due to its inherent multidisciplinary nature
&mdash; knowledge of mechanics, electronics, and software are all required.
My final project was in the application of novel estimator designs to
reduce the hardware requirements for actuators. Sometimes you don't need more
or better sensors, just a fancier algorithm.</p>
<p>During graduate school I became involved in several open-source projects,
mostly in the scientific python community. Projects I currently work on, or
have spent a significant time on in the past include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/">Dask</a> &mdash; a flexible parallel computing framework</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bokeh/datashader">Datashader</a> &mdash; a bin-based rendering toolchain</li>
<li><a href="http://sympy.org">SymPy</a> &mdash; a computer algebra system written in Python</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pydy/pydy">PyDy</a> &mdash; tools for dynamic systems analysis, in Python</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JuliaControl/ControlSystems.jl">ControlSystems.jl</a> &mdash; a control systems toolbox for Julia</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Interests</h2>
<p>I spend my free time on my hobbies. I started rock climbing around 6 years ago,
and that has easily become the most addicting thing in my life.  I also dance
West Coast Swing on a fairly regular basis (although not as often as I'd like).</p>
<h2>About the Name</h2>
<p>The name of this site comes from a term in dynamics/control theory referring to
a system that once hit with an impulse will oscillate forever, never growing or
shrinking in magnitude. While most of my academic research and focus was in the
field of control theory, I have <em>lots</em> of other interests too that I oscillate
between. I believe that this shift of interests isn't harmful, but actually
leads me to lead a fuller life, and (hopefully) become a better engineer in the
process.</p>
